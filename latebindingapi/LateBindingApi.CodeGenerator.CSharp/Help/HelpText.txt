#Optionals
for strong typed optional parameters you can't given System.Reflection.Missing.Value use 
 this option to set all optionals as object. the generated xml documentation header for the property
 or function tolds you the origin type.
#

#Camel
most common old COM Servers doesn't use camel casing. converting the first char to lower of parameter 
 name looks like more as a .NET application.
#

#Ref
a lot of methods has parameters given by reference(ref in C#). This is a default setting in visual basic6 
 for example, but in most cases it is not necesary. if you know you dont need ref, you can remove the attribute and
 the calling code looks more beautiful. the ref attribute in event parameters will not be removed.
#
