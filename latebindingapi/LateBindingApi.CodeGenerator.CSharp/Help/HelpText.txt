#Optionals
for strong typed optional parameters you can't given System.Reflection.Missing.Value
#

#Camel
most common old COM Servers doesn't use camel casing.
converting the first char to lower of parameter name looks like more as a .NET application
#

#Ref
a lot of methods has parameters given by reference(ref in C#). This is a default setting in visual basic6 for example,
but in most cases it is not necesary. if you know you dont need ref, you can remove the attribute and
the calling code looks more beautiful. ref parameters in events will not be removed.

Why .NET 4.0 is missing?
- C# 4.0 has different languages entities and more features. will coming soon as fast as possible.
